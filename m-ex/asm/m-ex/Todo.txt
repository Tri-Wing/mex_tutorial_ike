MUST DO
-change all onSwallow references to OFST_KirbyAbilityRuntimeStruct, dk's is here 800f0ff8
-modulate code to index kirby items @ 800f16f0
-note to self, the struct that contains pointers to the
ftDemo files has not been expanded! I believe
its right here 800beb70
-psInitParticle table might need to be expanded.
exists @ 804d0d58 and 804d0e5c. check notes for more info
-expand result screen size struct referenced during no contest @ 8017a8f4. each entry is 48 bytes...

MAYBE
-at the end of the ftData pointer table, there are some bits that
idk what they do. might have to modify this. codeline 800853dc interfaces w. this

IDEAS
-wolf up b hitting walls enters rebound?, ground rebound enters fall?
-css use icon positions
-investigate the queue effects function,s try to make char effects work

look into how when holding an item, ragdoll bones snap into place




Brainstorming how to easily clone fighters with their effects and items.
- function responsible for creating model effects is 8005be88(gxfID, fighter, position)
- function responsible for creating particle effects is 8039f05c(unk, effectfile, gxfID)
maybe i can inject on this functions and swap out the ids. particles will be tricky because there
are no references to the fighter passed in...




particle tables
804d08e8
    0x000 - int32, array of unk. runtime variables
    0x020 - array of live particles pointers? is accessed directly by codeline 8039fc9c
    0x060 - array of unk. (is == 0 when 803984f4.r6 == 0, otherwise its == r6), indexed by effect file ID
    0x164 - array of TextureGraphicsNum (0x0 of TextureGraphics in effect file), indexed by effect file ID
    0x268 - array of pointers to TextureGraphics Data (0x0 of TextureGraphics in effect file), indexed by effect file ID
    0x36C - array of unk. (is == 0 when 803984f4.r7 == 0), indexed by effect file ID
    0x470 - array of ParticleLast (ParticleIDStart + ParticleCount), indexed by effect file ID
    0x574 - array of pointers to Particles Data (0x4 of Particles in effect file), indexed by effect file ID

804d0f60 - directly referenced @ 80398c10
    0x000 - int32, unk
    0x004 - pointer to some obj
