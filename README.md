# TriWing's M-EX Tutorial code

This repo is an accompaniment to this youtube video https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WB5DBqSTGzo

It is only here so you can gett a better look at the source code. I have not provided any asset files which you would need to compile with. 

Instead of using the version of m-ex here for your character I would advise downloading a newer version of m-ex from https://github.com/akaneia/m-ex
