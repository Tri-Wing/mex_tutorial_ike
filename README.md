# TriWing's M-EX Tutorial code

This repo is an accompaniment to this youtube video https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WB5DBqSTGzo

It is only here so you can get a better look at the code written in the video, it is not in any way complete or bug-free. When I release Ike I will provide the full source code.
I have also not provided any asset files which you would need to compile with. To compile a different character you can export your file system to a folder named "filesystem" inside the "ike_tutorial" folder. You would also need to edit the .bat file with the appropriate file names for your character.

Instead of using the version of m-ex here for your character I would advise downloading a newer version of m-ex from https://github.com/akaneia/m-ex
